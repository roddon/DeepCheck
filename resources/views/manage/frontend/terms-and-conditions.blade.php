                            <ul class="privacy-ul">
                                <li>10.1. Any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the breach thereof, (except any claims for violation of intellectual property pursued by us), shall be settled by binding arbitration. The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone, or online. The number of arbitrators shall be one, and when conducted in person, the venue of the arbitration proceedings shall lie in London, United Kingdom at any place agreed upon amongst, or equally close to the parties. The arbitrator shall apply English law to all aspects of the arbitration. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The parties may litigate in court to compel arbitration, to stay proceeding pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator. In addition, we may litigate in court to seek injunctive relief. In the event of a dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or relating in any way to this Agreement, we shall be notified in writing. Within thirty (30) days of such notice, both Parties shall meet at an agreed location to attempt to resolve the dispute in good faith. Should the dispute not be resolved within thirty (30) days after such notice, the complaining Party shall seek remedies exclusively through arbitration.</li>

                                <li>10.2. The demand for arbitration shall be made within a reasonable time after the claim, dispute or other matter in question has arisen, and in no event, shall it be made after one (1) year from when the aggrieved party knew or should have known of the controversy, claim, dispute or breach.</li>

                                <li>10.3. All claims must be arbitrated on an individual basis, and cannot be consolidated in any arbitration with any claim or controversy of anyone else. Each party shall bear one half of the arbitration fees and costs incurred, and each party is responsible for its own attorney’s fees. We may agree to bear more than half of the arbitration fee on our own sole discretion. This section shall survive indefinitely regardless of the survival of this Agreement as a whole.</li>

                                <li>10.4. You understand and agree that by using the platform or services you hereby waive your right to approach the court or to participate in any class or representative action. Individual actions in small claims courts, intellectual property infringement actions and enforcement actions via federal, state, or local agencies shall be an exception to this section (10).</li>

                                <li>10.5. If any court or arbitrator determines that the limitation herein against Representative or Class actions is void or unenforceable or if they allow a class or representative action, the arbitration clause in this Agreement under Section (10) shall be null and void.
